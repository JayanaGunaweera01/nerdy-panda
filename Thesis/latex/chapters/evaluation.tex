\section{Chapter Overview}
After the designed prototype had been successfully implemented and was optimized to achieve the best performance through a large number of testing combinations, the system was evaluated with respective to the requirements gathered in the SRS chapter. This chapter is dedicated to the project's evaluation, which will involve self-evaluation as well as assessments from technical, domain and industry experts.

\section{Evaluation Methodology \& Approach}
Since the research project consists of models that can be quantitatively evaluated and another model that presents a more qualitative output, both qualitative \& quantitative evaluation approaches were taken. Based on the tests carried out in the testing chapter, the research outcome given by the prototype was evaluated using evaluation techniques of Recommendation Systems extracted from literature. In this chapter, a thematic analysis will be used to present the feedback received from experts.

\section{Evaluation Criteria}

The following criteria were used for the thematic analysis that surfaced in interviews with experts \& other aspects of research that needed to be assessed to determine the value of the research that was conducted.

\hline
\textbf{Criterion} & \textbf{Author's Self-evaluation} \endfirsthead 
\hline
Choice of research undertaken & The research area chosen revolved around a highly useful technical application as well as a very new \& popular domain that is expected to be used in many applications in the future. \\ 
\hline
Research contribution & The contributions of this research lie across a broad spectrum. Firstly, the technical contributions made in Recommendation Systems can be identified by the novel recommendations method introduced with the use of a custom algorithm to recommend trending items based on social media trends. Secondly, the contribution towards the domain is novel \& has opened new pathways to possible future work. \\ 
\hline
Quality of research documentation & The quality of the documentation is of the highest possible standard. The use of Latex for all the research documentation including the thesis signifies this, together with the quality of the diagrams \& content as well as the research papers written. \\
\hline
Development approach & A significant effort has been put into data collection \& pre-processing to give the best possible results with a very meagre amount of data. Cutting edge-languages \& tools have also been used in the process. \\
\hline
Quantitative analysis of results & Even though the quantitative analysis \& evaluation of the results produced by the system is difficult to be measured, jupyter notebooks have been used to demonstrate these using graphical outputs in a comprehensible format. \\ 
\hline
Usability, UI/ UX of MVP & The UI/UX of the final product has been developed in a very usable \& attractive manner. \\

\section{Selection of Evaluators}
The selection categories of evaluators for the project can be broken down into the following 3 categories.
% Evaluations were received by Blockchain domain experts, Data Science \& Engineering experts \& possible end-users of the application.

\section{Limitations of Evaluation}
As discussed in the literature review, it is very difficult to evaluate a Recommendations System, especially one that is specific to a particular use-case. Therefore, the testing \& evaluation equations had to be adjusted to suit these.
The social trends based Recommendations System was the most difficult to evaluate due to the lack of data that was available to the author.
Since the domain is very new, there were very few people who could understand the impact of the domain contribution \& why some choices had to be made.\\
Long hours of power-cuts throughout the evaluation phase of the project made it very difficult to setup meetings with evaluators and work on evaluation aspects of the research.

\section{Evaluation of Functional Requirements}
The breakdown of the evaluation of functional requirements can be found in the table \nameref{tab:eval-func-requirements} of \textbf{\nameref{appendix:C}}

\section{Evaluation of Non-functional Requirements}
The breakdown of the evaluation of non-functional requirements can be found in the table \nameref{tab:eval-non-func-requirements} of \textbf{\nameref{appendix:C}}

\section{Chapter Summary}
This chapter covered the evaluation aspects of the research that was conducted. The approaches taken for evaluation were discussed with reasoning of choosing each method. The criteria for evaluation was defined prior to the author's self-evalution \& feedback from evaluators. The opinions received form evaluators were broken down into themes and presented based on the pre-defined criterion. Finally the functional \& non-functional requirements were evaluated.
