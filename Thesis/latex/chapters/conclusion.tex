\section{Achievement of Research Aim \& Objectives}

\subsection{Achievement of Aims}
\textit{The aim of this research is to design, develop \& evaluate a novel Recommendation Architecture that will provide relevant, trending, timely, and worthy \gls{nft}s for trading purposes by automating some of the decision making steps that the user would otherwise have to do manually.}

The aim of the research was successfully achieved by desigining, developing \& evaluating a novel Recommendations Architecture to produce relevant, trending, timely. Multiple steps of the process were automated to meet with the requirement. Furthermore, research was conducted to identify what models could be used to recommend worthy \gls{nft}s.

\subsection{Achievement of Objectives}

\hline
\textbf{Module(s)} & \textbf{Utilized Knowledge}\endfirsthead 
\hline
Software Development Group Project & From recognizing an issue to designing, developing, and testing a prototype, this module gave the initial spark to work on research \& publish research. \\
\hline
Algorithms: Theory Design and Implementation, Applied AI & The knowledge gained from these modules were extremely important when designing new performant algorithms in this research. They also gave quite a lot of knowledge that was used for data science model development. \\
\hline
Programming Principles 1, 2 \& Object Oriented Programming & These modules laid the foundation to programming design used for documentation \& coding concepts used in development of the project. \\
\hline
Enterprise Application Development & Gave a thorough understanding of design documentation \& standard that need to be maintained in Enterprise applications. \\
\hline
Web Design and Development & The prototype was made with UI/ UX guidlines taught in this module. The foundation laid by HTML, CSS \& JavaScript was also helpful as a foundation to go beyond and build perfomant \& advanced UIs. \\

\section{Use of Existing Skills}
% (What is learned from the course? form or outside? applied to the project)
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fullstack R\&D Development} - The author completed his internship at Zone24x7 where he got to work on fullstack development of R\&D Big Data projects while getting exposed to cutting-edge technologies.
\item \textbf{Blockchain} - The research required quite a lot of understanding in the domain of Blockchain, since \gls{nft}s are one such application of Blockchain technology. It was important to understand people's thinking patterns \& decision making steps to come up with automation tactics required to produce recommendations. The knowledge for this was gained by the author's involvement in Blockchain \& decentralized systems projects at Niftron, the Blockchain Research Group of IIT which was done in collaboration with 99x technology on Blockchain projects\& personal reading.
\item \textbf{\gls{ml}/ \gls{dl}} - The author self-learnt basic \gls{ml} \& \gls{dl} prior to the start of the final year by watching tutorial videos on Youtube \& Coursera.
\end{itemize}


\section{Use of New Skills}
% What you have learned through the project – Not part of the curriculum) – Technical skills should be given preference
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Recommendation Systems} - The author had no prior experience of working with Recommendation Systems. Multiple methods of building Recommendation Systems were learnt using online freely available  material such as Google \gls{ml} courses, Coursera, Medium, Kaggle \& Youtube.
\item \textbf{Data Engineering/ Data Mining \& Information Retrieval} - The author had to learn rigorous data mining \& information retrieval techniques that were required to find the most important information that could be used for the solution since the quality of pre-processing would directly affect the outputs produced.
% \item \textbf{\gls{nft}s} - The author had to self-explore many possibilities of how \gls{nft}s could be recommended since there was no past research related to such applications of \gls{nft}s.
\item \textbf{\gls{nlp}} - Natural Language Processing was used heavily for data extraction \& matching, especially in the pre-processing steps. Additional tutorials \& blogs were followed to understand these concepts.
\item \textbf{\LaTeX }- Used for clear documentation of all research documents for professional typesetting of lasting value. This includes the project proposal, PSPD, Thesis, 2 research papers \& 1 review paper.
\end{itemize}

\section{Deviations}
% Any deviations from the original plan should be mentioned and justified
The initial goals of the author was to integrate price-prediction into the system at least in an insignificant manner, but the available data was not sufficient for this purpose and the amount of time \& effort required to fetch \& pre-process data made it clear that it would be required to be done as a separate project.

After considering possible \gls{dl} methods to build a Recommendations Model, it was understood that the amount of data available was not sufficient to attempt it. Algorithmic \gls{ml} models were created instead.

\section{Limitations of the Research}
% Should be linked with the test output
\begin{itemize}
% \item Since the \gls{nft} domain is very new \& there wasn't any research done on \gls{nft}s prior to starting the research, it was extremely difficult to find evaluators for the project. Those who were able to evaluate the project without much difficulty had comparatively low amount of paper-qualifications/ prior research experience.
% \item Testing \& evaluating the suggested models was challenging
\item Since this project was one of the very first of its kind, there were very limited number of scientific documents, data \& a clear direction to follow. 
% \item The novelty of the research \& specificities of the domain made it pretty much impossible to benchmark the system against existing solutions. 2 of the \gls{ml} models were benchmarked against each other.
\item  The limited time allocated for the research and the need to spend a lot of time mining \& pre-processing data, constrained the author from working on price-prediction and considering the trading \& value aspect of \gls{nft}s for recommendations.
\item The trends based model is only effective if accurate, diverse descriptions are provided for \gls{nft}s.
\item Personalized recommendations cannot be made with the current trends-based model.
\item The words in hashtags aren't split although received as trends. This decreases the possibility of matching with keywords of items.
\item The system works in a centralized manner.
\item The current system may struggle with large-scale system \& data since pure Python \& Pandas are used for the data science component.
\item % >> only twitter trends used
\end{itemize}

\section{Achievement of the Contribution to Body of Knowledge}
%  explain in para - maybe highlight points?

% point out that no SL e-commerce site provides recommendations & this will help generate recommendations without having to collect & store a lot of data

\section{Concluding Remarks}
This concludes a research which lays the ground work for future \gls{nft} research projects \& novel ways of generating recommendations using sparse data. The introduced algorithm has the potential to evolve into a much complex \& utilitarian Recommendation System which may be embraced by digital systems \& internet of the next decade.
The research process was conducted at the highest possible standards signifying the contributions made to the body of knowledge.
