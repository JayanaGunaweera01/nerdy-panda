\textit{"This research is well motivated and attempts to address an interesting research gap which is due to the unique nature of NFTs and the way they are traded. The researcher has investigated alternatives to the widely used technique, Collaborative Filtering which may be difficult to adapt to the case of  NFT recommendations. The research is thus focused on three main approaches; trait content-, trait rarity- and trend-based techniques. In this way, the research has been able to  satisfactorily address the research gap.
The researcher has approached  the solution in a straight-forward manner with well founded choices. His solution is based on the state-of-the-art domain knowledge as well as adequate software. 
The researcher has provided solutions of good quality. His contributions are impressive, considering the fact that the work  has led to (at least) two publications and is carried out as an undergraduate project. The work also touches upon  many areas, including different recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, deep learning (including LSTM and Transformers), NLP and different evaluation metrics etc. But most importantly, the researcher has implemented and evaluated recommendation systems suitable for NFTs, and hence contributed with novel results.}
\\

&
\textit{The models have been tested/evaluated and the results give some insight into  their properties. However, this could have been done in a more systematic manner,  tying evaluation more purposefully to a concrete research question.  For example, a research question such as "which of the three approaches and their combinations  is the best one?" could have been formulated and evaluations could have been designed to answer this question.  Further,   the models could have been evaluated with respect to a quantitative metric such as recommendation accuracy in addition to the qualitative metric Aggregate Diversity.
Documentation  of the work  could have been improved.  The researcher could have described the aim of the work, method and  data sets (both training and testing) with more clarity and details using a better organized text. It is also important to provide a clear set of conclusions anchored to the   plots,  calculated metrics and other numerical results."}\\

\textit{"Research methodology-wise, this is quite well-done and thorough. I feel that there is a little over-emphasis on the software product development aspects such as requirements analysis and project management, given the highly technical core problem that is addressed, which is a complex one on its own even as a theoretically modeled one. Having said that, those areas are also covered with a proficient level of detail and attention. This may be due to the nature of the study required, which is software and research combined.
This reviewer has a background of both on-going academic research as well as industrial software product development for global clients in the areas of recommendation and sentiment analysis. The level of details covered in the thesis on the software aspects is exceptionally good and well thought out.

\textit{
For instance, decisions made on the architectural aspects, such as building the components in a microservices architecture, are in line with the matured industry standards, but not common to see in undergraduate-level work. I would be happier if there was a little more detail in those areas of the design as well.
I do not think the discussion on the development platform to the level of justifying the Operating system, version control and IDEs is necessary.  
On the problem of the recommender system itself, I have a few comments:  
First, the problem itself is intriguing, and quite relevant as an interesting problem. The author's analysis of the domain and literature review shows that enough effort has been spent on background. There are few concerns that I have, like relying on Twitter for sentiments, but given the scope of the project there is not much that can be done here; Sentiment analysis does not always practically deliver as much as the promise, due to the diversity and sparseness of data available. However, this is a limitation of the domain rather than the authors' work. I would have liked an analysis of what sort of information was gathered from the sentiment analysis. The same limitation goes for collaborative filtering. This is mentioned, but not enough detail given. Given the scope of the project, it's understandable if the author could not tackle all these issues, as the problem is systematic in a still emerging market of NFTs.  
Overall, the problem addressed, and the solution proposed is interesting, and the work carried out is ambitious."} \\

\textit{"Good topic. I noticed, the mixing of NFT idea and use of recommendation systems are not clearly tallied in the research problem / gap.
The conducted research has been able to 'Satisfactory'-ly address the identified research gap. The touch on recommendation systems perspective is lacking , specialling integration with NFT.
Why NFT and Recommendation systems combination is not very prominent in the video clip shared. Why other approches not eligible to link with NFT ?
Contributions are good, however, strong justificications are required, by compling the findings with evaluation results. Didn`t notice a strong evaluation segment, rather than, few stasitical outputs.
Satisfactory - Testing \& Evaluation of the developed module. I feel more testing is needed. Not only technical and statistical tests. But stakeholder view assesment and relating it with the research gap justification is required.
As suggested improvements: Presentation of your idea is complex. Audio is also very low.  It should have a gradual flow for the audience to slowly and steadily understand it. Convincing a complex technical ideal in an understandable manner is also a mandatory skill need to be developed by a researcher / scholar.

Yes - based on the resources shared related to this work, the conducted research has been able to address the identified research gap.
Appreciative approach on choosing the recommendation system for the proposed solution. The researcher seems to have done a very good literature search on the existing recommendation systems to finalise the approach for this work.
The solution and the contributions (specially the research paper I found in the open-access archive) might start a new direction towards the NFT recommendation systems.
One suggestion would be to compare proposed models with a baseline. (But since this is domain-specific and novel, choosing the baseline would be challenging!).
I would suggest to use different (more) recommendation systems to improve the evaluation.

\textit{"This research becomes a novel solution due to the application of multiple recommendation algorithms to recommend a digital object like NFT that has a high willing to pay and fast moving nature. Considering the value of the object with the time and not being sticking to collaborative filtering opens up a good research area. Applying a ensemble of a recommendation approach to mitigate the timely recommendation of objects can be considered as the appropriate approach and the novelty is reflected through this approach. Identifying the research problem followed by identifying technical gaps in recommendation systems is a good starting point to go for the solution. Application of social trends to the recommendation model and the novel trends score calculation algorithm can be considered as a a great contribution by the researcher. Testing and evaluation done on the multiple models and a fair comparison done to show the importance of using both the models.
Could have emphasized on the accuracy of the model since this solution going to impact the end users business or the capital."}

 \textit{"The research is interesting with NFTs being a relatively new area. The research gap identified is useful for identifying new NFTs. With the NFT marketplace growing rapidly, recommendation systems are going to be needed. The researcher has considered many angles to address the research gap by experimenting with multiple models and approaches. The researcher has excelled in identifying the necessary areas to provide a recommendation to a potential buyer, considering the data that can be accessed for each NFT. The researcher has approached the problem by relating the NFTs as individual products and using their specific traits for recommendation. Since the blockchain is used for privacy and protection of users, this is a good approach. The researcher has provided a good model that has been researched, implemented and evaluated well. A novel approach was provided for recommendations in the NFT domain. The researcher has evaluated the solution well in technical aspects. it would be good if the researcher could approach people and survey them based on the recommendations provided by the recommendation engine.

\textit{"The identified gap seems wide and looks good for an undergraduate research. Recommendation systems and algorithms have been there for a long time now but getting that approach and applying it in a newly rising field such as NFTs is great. The identified wide research gap has been addressed with this research. It is a good approach, implementing multiple types of recommendation models for recommendations based on different aspects. The solution that has been implemented seems to be working fine and the contributions are also great for an undergraduate research. I would suggest to evaluate the implemented models by their performance against some other models in the domain. That would make it easier for anyone to identify where this model stands compared to other models in the domain."}

 \textit{"Research gap is much needed to analyze the trend as its a NFT hype period and people would love a system to filter the best NFTs to trade. Research has covered the overall area of the research gap. Researcher has approached the research in more generic state where it could have been categorized and analyzed based on several parameters. Valuable NFTs could have evaluated by different parameters such as country, age, domain(art, game NFT), etc. The solution covers recommendations made on top trending NFTs on social media which are most famous ones, but does trending only enough to correlate with the value is the real question here. Should consider NFT utilities, buy and sell trend, no of bids, and visibility as well to identify the top NFTs"}

 \textit{"The research provides useful background to the topic and the concept map further displays the various sectors of the research. The identified research gap is made clear as NFTs are a relatively new technology and the challenges of NFT recommendation systems can be understood due to their uniqueness. 
 The conducted research discovers areas of exploration to address the research gap by identifying previously researched attempts to address the problem that include content-based, collaborative-based and personalized recommendation systems. The research highlights the potential of matching content with social trends along for better recommendations. 
 The researcher has approached the solution in a comprehensive manner and expands on relevant previous work and ideas. The incorporation of social media throughout the project is also done well.
 The solutions provided in this project take into account a variety of factors that can be useful for the recommendation of NFTs. The use of a trend score in the design is particularly interesting and can be of great benefit to the recommendations as social media has been a major driving force behind the sudden rise in popularity of NFTs. Additionally, incorporating a rarity based model in the design fits well with the overall theme of NFTs and their inherent uniqueness which can drive user interest based on scarcity. Moreover, the content similarity matching model serves as a good integration of existing methodology.
 The developed models were tested and evaluated appropriately. However, it would be useful to see a more comparable evaluation metric for the Trends Based Model to allow for easy comparison with the other models.
 Although specific examples of NFTs are mentioned in the project, it would be useful to see details about the reference NFTs and further clarification on the obtained recommendation results for each model in order to clearly observe their connection to the reference NFT."}

 \textit{"NFT market is expected to reach around \$150 billion by 2026 and it is fast growing. NFT trading platforms are available but recommendation systems are not common. Therefore this is a good research area. The research gap has been addressed to a considerable extent. A scientific approach has been taken to approach the solution. Based on tweets but it is sufficient work for an undergraduate project. Evaluation is comprehensive.

 \textit{"It is a interesting research gap that's been addressed here. It is surely the proper direction. The work shown has addressed the research gap. I would say this is a good starting point and will make a good MVP. The solutions \& contributions made have a strong foundation and is well presented. With systems like these you'll need a continuous training system to keep the model up-to-date. I would prefer the testing to be more extensive and have a maybe keep track of ROIs of the recommended NFT to determine performance.
 In a trader's point of view I would prefer trading bots for making quicker trades. In terms of the AI, I feel like the evaluation must be more convincing. And yes its best if you could benchmark the inference speeds of the system just to get a rough idea. 
I think your solutions could be better, if you could direct you focus on artists in particular. Tracking their activity or something along those lines. Reason being I would opt for long term trades where the main factor is the artist rather than the hype. And need to differentiate the model from pump and dumps. Most common pitfall I have seen."}

\textit{"This is a new venture especially in the NFT space as this approach has not yet surfaced or ever implemented among major NFT marketplaces such as Opensea, Axie Marketplace and Binance etc. The gap identified is relevant to the concept of a NFT, since an NFT asset is usually sold in limited supply or as a single unit. This is one of the main challenges that come with purchasing an NFT,  to which the following research is expected to resolve. Yes, the conducted research has been able to address the identified research gap. This approach taken isn’t yet noticed on NFT marketplaces, but by introducing such a system would become a versatile tool to the user/consumer interested in purchasing an NFT. 
Using the trend based model in filtering out NFTs, could present a list of viable assets that are close enough to its existing predecessors traits that had been sold out from the collection, which would have the potential to become more valuable. With that in mind, social influence also does have a positive correlation on the success of an NFT collection/brand. For e.g. CryptoPunks.
With the combined use of the trait content and rarity models, both of which are normally included on a NFT, could allow the end user to tailor the results based on their preferences over such features.
Each model's outcome and results were evidently shown on the summarized research.
Since the research currently focuses on the social trends revolving around NFTs. It might be interesting to see in the future whether the system could also prevent fraudulent NFTs from appearing in the results. As most common NFT scams artificially or hack in order to boost  up their social presence of their NFTs, which would affect the end user if encountered."}

 \textit{"Since NFTs started getting attention recently, the identified research gap seems new, which is good. Yes, the conducted research has been able to address the identified research gap. I feel like you have done an in depth research with a lot of statistics which I saw from the video attached. The solution seems pretty good and how the scores for negative, neutral and positive is calculated as a part of the solution is very understandable."}

 \textit{"Clear gap and issue with the traditional collaborative filtering method has been addressed. Yes, the conducted research has been able to address the identified research gap. A straightforward and methodical approach solving each problem at a time, rather than having a direct jump to model construction, especially since this is a novel research topic. The issue of using only a single model to perform recommendations was clear and the approach taken was explained well.  The approach of using the pre-trained twitter model to conduct a sentiment analysis evaluation was well done and the reasoning for doing so was explained well. This technique of evaluation is pretty much best in class."}
