  abstract = {The demand of recommendation has aroused severely since there are huge number of choices available and the end user desires to extract information in least time and with high accuracy. The traditional recommendation systems generate recommendations in the same domain but now cross domain recommendations are gaining importance. The cross domain recommendations address well the limitations of single domain analysis such as data sparsity and cold start problem. Under this research work cross domain recommendation model is designed based on the study of various supervised classification algorithms. 3 domains are under consideration music, movie and book. Model is capable of generating one to many cross domain recommendations exploiting movie domain knowledge to generate recommendations for books and music. Data is collected through survey and data pre-processing has been performed. Study is carried out over K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Gaussian Na\"ive Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers and also over majority voting Ensembling, cross validation and data sampling by applying these classifiers to choose the best classifier to form the base of content-based recommendation. Recommendation model uses a hybrid approach of combination of content-based recommendation, user to user collaborative filtering and personalized recommendation techniques. The model perform Twitter sentiment analysis over the recommended entities generated by the model to help the user in decision making by knowing the positive, negative and neutral polarity percentage based on tweets done by people. The designed model achieved good accuracy on testing.},

In this paper, we propose a new evaluation framework (TweetEval) consisting of seven heterogeneous Twitter-specific classification tasks. We also provide a strong set of baselines as starting point, and compare different language modeling pre-training strategies. Our initial experiments show the effectiveness of starting off with existing pre-trained generic language models, and continue training them on Twitter corpora.},

This already large volume of user-generated content is dramatically growing every day, making it hard for consumers to filter out the worthwhile information which appears on the various review sites. There commendation system plays a significant role in solving the problem of information overload. This study proposes a framework which integrates a collaborative filtering approach and an opinion mining technique for movie recommendation. Within the proposed framework, sentiment analysis is first applied to the users' reviews to detect consumer opinions about the movie they have watched and to explore the individual's preference profile. Traditional recommendation models are overly dependent on preference ratings and often suffer from the problem of `data sparsity'. Experimental results obtained from real online reviews show that our proposed method is effective in dealing with insufficient data and is more accurate and efficient than existing traditional methods.},

  abstract = {Deep learning techniques have become the method of choice for researchers working on algorithmic aspects of recommender systems. With the strongly increased interest in machine learning in general, it has, as a result, become difficult to keep track of what represents the state-of-the-art at the moment, e.g., for top-n recommendation tasks. At the same time, several recent publications point out problems in today's research practice in applied machine learning, e.g., in terms of the reproducibility of the results or the choice of the baselines when proposing new models. In this work, we report the results of a systematic analysis of algorithmic proposals for top-n recommendation tasks. Specifically, we considered 18 algorithms that were presented at top-level research conferences in the last years. Only 7 of them could be reproduced with reasonable effort. For these methods, it however turned out that 6 of them can often be outperformed with comparably simple heuristic methods, e.g., based on nearest-neighbor or graph-based techniques. The remaining one clearly outperformed the baselines but did not consistently outperform a well-tuned non-neural linear ranking method. Overall, our work sheds light on a number of potential problems in today's machine learning scholarship and calls for improved scientific practices in this area.

In the past few years, in particular, approaches based on deep learning (neural) techniques have become dominant in the literature. For all of them, substantial progress over the state-of-the-art is claimed. However, indications exist of certain problems in today's research practice, e.g., with respect to the choice and optimization of the baselines used for comparison, raising questions about the published claims. To obtain a better understanding of the actual progress, we have compared recent results in the area of neural recommendation approaches based on collaborative filtering against a consistent set of existing simple baselines. The worrying outcome of the analysis of these recent works\textemdash all were published at prestigious scientific conferences between 2015 and 2018\textemdash is that 11 of the 12 reproducible neural approaches can be outperformed by conceptually simple methods, e.g., based on the nearest-neighbor heuristic or linear models. None of the computationally complex neural methods was actually consistently better than already existing learning-based techniques, e.g., using matrix factorization or linear models. In our analysis, we discuss common issues in today's research practice, which, despite the many papers that are published on the topic, have apparently led the field to a certain level of stagnation.1},

  abstract = {Markets for unique digital property\textemdash digital equivalents of rare artworks, collectible trading cards, and other assets that gain value from scarcity\textemdash have exploded in the past several months. At root is the next iteration of blockchain technology, unique digital assets called non-fungible tokens. Unlike Bitcoin, where one coin is the same as another, NFTs are unique, each with different attributes. An NFT that represented ownership of Boardwalk would be quite different from one that represented Baltic Avenue. NFTs have grown from a few early breakout successes to a rapidly developing market for unique digital treasures. The attraction to buyers is that unlike digital assets like e-books or licensed movies, NFTs can be bought, sold, displayed, gifted, or even destroyed just like personal property. Yet law has not kept pace with demand for unique digital property. In particular, the rules designed for the 2000s internet focused on expanding intellectual property licenses and online contracts to the point that we are mere users, not owners, of digital assets. This article proposes a clear path for the evolution of the legal underpinnings of NFTs. It argues that NFTs are personal property, not contracts (despite the ``smart contracts'' popular nomenclature) or pure intellectual property licenses (despite the currently governing law of digital assets like e-books). Because transactions in NFTs are in the form of a sale, the law of sales of personal property should apply. And finally, the article notes that NFTs will serve as a powerful grounding example of digital personal property, a legal form of ownership that is both sorely needed and has not yet been clearly established online. That example will ground others, and permit law to again characterize those who buy scarce and valuable digital assets as true owners rather than mere users.},

However, given the proven power of latent factor models, some newer neural approaches incorporate them within more complex network architectures. One specific idea, recently put forward by several researchers, is to consider potential correlations between the latent factors, i.e., embeddings, by applying convolutions over the user-item interaction map. However, contrary to what is claimed in these articles, such interaction maps do not share the properties of images where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly useful. In this work, we show through analytical considerations and empirical evaluations that the claimed gains reported in the literature cannot be attributed to the ability of CNNs to model embedding correlations, as argued in the original papers. Moreover, additional performance evaluations show that all of the examined recent CNN-based models are outperformed by existing non-neural machine learning techniques or traditional nearest-neighbor approaches. On a more general level, our work points to major methodological issues in recommender systems research.},

  year = {2011},
  abstract = {Factorization Machines (FM) are a new model class that combines the advantages of polynomial regression models with factorization models. Like polynomial regression models, FMs are a general model class working with any real valued feature vector as input for the prediction of real-valued, ordinal or categorical dependent variables as output. However, in contrast to polynomial regression models, FMs replace two-way and all other higher order interaction effects by their factorized analogues. The factorization of higher order interactions enables efficient parameter estimation even for sparse datasets where just a few or even no observations for those higher order effects are available. Polynomial regression models without this factorization fail. This work discusses the relationship of FMs to polynomial regression models and the conceptual difference between factorizing and non-factorizing model parameters of polynomial regression models. Additionally, we show that the model equation of factorized polynomial regression models can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be learned efficiently. Apart from polynomial regression models, we also focus on the other origin of FMs: factorization models. We show that the standard factorization models matrix factorization and parallel factor analysis are a special case of FMs and additionally how recently proposed and successfully applied factorization models like SVD++ can be represented by FMs. The drawback of typical factorization models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only for categorical input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task. By knowing that FMs can mimic these models just by choosing the appropriate input data, we finally conclude that deriving a learning algorithm, e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS), for FMs once is sufficient to get the learning algorithms for all factorization models automatically, thus saving a lot of time and effort.},

This gave birth to the recommender system comes wherein the content providers recommend users the content according to the users' taste and liking. In this paper we have proposed a movie recommendation system. A movie recommendation is important in our social life due to its features such as suggesting a set of movies to users based on their interest, or the popularities of the movies. In this paper we are proposing a movie recommendation system that has the ability to recommend movies to a new user as well as the other existing users. It mines movie databases to collect all the important information, such as, popularity and attractiveness, which are required for recommendation. We use content-based and collaborative filtering and also hybrid filtering, which is a combination of the results of these two techniques, to construct a system that provides more precise recommendations concerning movies.},

This research work augments heuristic-driven user interest profiling with reviewer credibility analysis and fine-grained feature sentiment analysis to devise a robust recommendation methodology. The proposed credibility, interest and sentiment enhanced recommendation (CISER) model has five modules namely candidate feature extraction, reviewer credibility analysis, user interest mining, candidate feature sentiment assignment and recommendation module. Review corpus is given as an input to the CISER model. Candidate feature extraction module uses context and sentiment confidence to extract features of importance. To make our model robust to fake and unworthy reviews and reviewers, reviewer credibility analysis proffers an approach of associating expertise, trust and influence scores with reviewers to weigh their opinion according to their credibility. The user interest mining module uses aesthetics of review writing as heuristics for interest-pattern mining. The candidate feature sentiment assignment module scores candidate features present in review based on their fastText sentiment polarity. Finally, the recommendation module uses credibility weighted sentiment scoring of user preferred features for purchase recommendations. The proposed recommendation methodology harnesses not only numeric ratings, but also sentiment expressions associated with features, customer preference profile and reviewer credibility for quantitative analysis of various alternative products. The mean average precision (MAP@1) for CISER is 93\% and MAP@3 is 49\%, which is better than current state-of-the-art systems.},

Traditionally, the dot product or higher order equivalents have been used to combine two or more embeddings, e.g., most notably in matrix factorization. In recent years, it was suggested to replace the dot product with a learned similarity e.g. using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). This approach is often referred to as neural collaborative filtering (NCF). In this work, we revisit the experiments of the NCF paper that popularized learned similarities using MLPs. First, we show that with a proper hyperparameter selection, a simple dot product substantially outperforms the proposed learned similarities. Second, while a MLP can in theory approximate any function, we show that it is non-trivial to learn a dot product with an MLP. Finally, we discuss practical issues that arise when applying MLP based similarities and show that MLPs are too costly to use for item recommendation in production environments while dot products allow to apply very efficient retrieval algorithms. We conclude that MLPs should be used with care as embedding combiner and that dot products might be a better default choice.},

Transformer architectures have facilitated building higher-capacity models and pretraining has made it possible to effectively utilize this capacity for a wide variety of tasks. Transformers is an open-source library with the goal of opening up these advances to the wider machine learning community. The library consists of carefully engineered state-of-the art Transformer architectures under a unified API. Backing this library is a curated collection of pretrained models made by and available for the community. Transformers is designed to be extensible by researchers, simple for practitioners, and fast and robust in industrial deployments. The library is available at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.},

The dataset is based on on-chain NFT Transfer events as its core. We have also created several derived tables which make the data convenient to analyze. The NFT market is booming in a way that very few people anticipated at the beginning of this year. This has led to comparisons of today's NFT mania to the 17th century Dutch tulip mania. We are releasing this dataset so that people may form their own opinions and insights about the NFT market based on the analysis of hard data.},
