\section{Chapter Overview}
This chapter explains the core implementation of the research prototype together with the technologies, languages \& supporting tools used for development of the prototype, with reasoning to the choice of each selection.

\section{Technology Selection}

\subsection{Technology Stack}

% Technologies used in various tiers or layers using a diagram.

\subsection{Data Selection}
% Data Selection (if data science project)


\subsection{Selection of development framework}
% Use a table to justify your selection for each of them.


\subsection{Programming language}
% Justify what you’re using, why you’re using it.

\subsection{Libraries Utilized}
% Tabular form and justify.

\subsection{IDE’s Utilized}
% Tabular form and justify.

\subsection{Summary of Technology selection}
% tabular form


\section{Implementation of core functionalities}
% Discuss core functionalities with support of code segments.

\section{Self-Reflection}
% reflection on your current prototype.

\section{Video Demo}
% Upload video to Youtube as unlisted video and provide Link to video demo
