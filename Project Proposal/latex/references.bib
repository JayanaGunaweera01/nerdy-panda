	abstract = {The demand of recommendation has aroused severely since there are huge number of choices available and the end user desires to extract information in least time and with high accuracy. The traditional recommendation systems generate recommendations in the same domain but now cross domain recommendations are gaining importance. The cross domain recommendations address well the limitations of single domain analysis such as data sparsity and cold start problem. Under this research work cross domain recommendation model is designed based on the study of various supervised classification algorithms. 3 domains are under consideration music, movie and book. Model is capable of generating one to many cross domain recommendations exploiting movie domain knowledge to generate recommendations for books and music. Data is collected through survey and data pre-processing has been performed. Study is carried out over K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers and also over majority voting Ensembling, cross validation and data sampling by applying these classifiers to choose the best classifier to form the base of content-based recommendation. Recommendation model uses a hybrid approach of combination of content-based recommendation, user to user collaborative filtering and personalized recommendation techniques. The model perform Twitter sentiment analysis over the recommended entities generated by the model to help the user in decision making by knowing the positive, negative and neutral polarity percentage based on tweets done by people. The designed model achieved good accuracy on testing.},

User comments are important for recommender systems because they include various types of emotional information that may influence the correctness or precision of the recommendation. Improving the accuracy of user ratings from obtained feasible recommendations is essential. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model to process user comments and to generate a possible user rating for user recommendations. First, the system uses sentiment analysis to create a feature vector as the input nodes. Next, the system implements noise reduction in the data set to improve the classification of user ratings. Finally, a deep belief network and sentiment analysis ({DBNSA}) achieves data learning for the recommendations. The experimental results indicated that this system has better accuracy than traditional methods.},

In addition, we design a specialized parallelization scheme utilizing model parallelism on the embedding tables to mitigate memory constraints while exploiting data parallelism to scale-out compute from the fully-connected layers. We compare {DLRM} against existing recommendation models and characterize its performance on the Big Basin {AI} platform, demonstrating its usefulness as a benchmark for future algorithmic experimentation and system co-design.},

	title = {Tokenized: The Law of Non-Fungible Tokens and Unique Digital Property},
	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3821102},
	shorttitle = {Tokenized},
	abstract = {Markets for unique digital property—digital equivalents of rare artworks, collectible trading cards, and other assets that gain value from scarcity—have exploded in the past several months. At root is the next iteration of blockchain technology, unique digital assets called non-fungible tokens. Unlike Bitcoin, where one coin is the same as another, {NFTs} are unique, each with different attributes. An {NFT} that represented ownership of Boardwalk would be quite different from one that represented Baltic Avenue. {NFTs} have grown from a few early breakout successes to a rapidly developing market for unique digital treasures. The attraction to buyers is that unlike digital assets like e-books or licensed movies, {NFTs} can be bought, sold, displayed, gifted, or even destroyed just like personal property. Yet law has not kept pace with demand for unique digital property. In particular, the rules designed for the 2000s internet focused on expanding intellectual property licenses and online contracts to the point that we are mere users, not owners, of digital assets. This article proposes a clear path for the evolution of the legal underpinnings of {NFTs}. It argues that {NFTs} are personal property, not contracts (despite the “smart contracts” popular nomenclature) or pure intellectual property licenses (despite the currently governing law of digital assets like e-books). Because transactions in {NFTs} are in the form of a sale, the law of sales of personal property should apply. And finally, the article notes that {NFTs} will serve as a powerful grounding example of digital personal property, a legal form of ownership that is both sorely needed and has not yet been clearly established online. That example will ground others, and permit law to again characterize those who buy scarce and valuable digital assets as true owners rather than mere users.},

There commendation system plays a significant role in solving the problem of information overload. This study proposes a framework which integrates a collaborative filtering approach and an opinion mining technique for movie recommendation. Within the proposed framework, sentiment analysis is first applied to the users’ reviews to detect consumer opinions about the movie they have watched and to explore the individual’s preference profile. Traditional recommendation models are overly dependent on preference ratings and often suffer from the problem of ‘data sparsity’. Experimental results obtained from real online reviews show that our proposed method is effective in dealing with insufficient data and is more accurate and efficient than existing traditional methods.},

	abstract = {Recommender Systems are software tools and techniques providing suggestions for items to be of use to a user. Recommender systems have proven to be a valuable means for online users to cope with the virtual information overload and have become one of the most powerful and popular tools in electronic commerce. Correspondingly, various techniques for recommendation generation have been proposed during the last decade. In this paper we present a new benchmark framework. It allows researchers or practitioners to quickly try out and compare different recommendation methods on new data sets. Extending the framework is easy thanks to a simple and well-defined Application Programming Interface ({API}). It contains a plug-in mechanism allowing others to develop their own algorithms and incorporate them in the framework. An interactive graphical user interface is provided for setting new benchmarks, integrate new plug-ins with the framework, setting up configurations and exploring benchmark results.},
